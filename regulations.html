  <H1>Warning: Compliance with Drone Regulations</H1>
  <br>
  <p>Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), are a popular and versatile tool for various purposes, including photography, videography, surveying, and more. 
    However, operating drones comes with responsibilities. It is essential to be aware of and adhere to your local and national drone regulations. 
    Failure to do so can result in legal consequences and compromise safety.</p>
